                    <h2>Instructions: </h2>
                    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
                    <p>First, prepare your vegetables. You need 1-1.25kg ripe tomatoes. If the tomatoes
                        are on their vines, pull them off. The green stalky bits should come off at the same time, but
                        if they don't, just pull or twist them off afterwards. Throw the vines and green bits away and
                        wash the tomatoes. Now cut each tomato into quarters and slice off any hard cores (they don't
                        soften during cooking and you'd get hard bits in the soup at the end). Peel 1 medium onion and 1
                        small carrot and chop them into small pieces. Chop 1 celery stick roughly the same size.
                    </p>
                    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
                    <p>Spoon 2 tbsp olive oil into a large heavy-based pan and heat it over a low heat. Hold your hand
                        over the pan until you can feel the heat rising from the oil, then tip in the onion, carrot and
                        celery and mix them together with a wooden spoon. Still with the heat low, cook the vegetables
                        until they're soft and faintly coloured. This should take about 10 minutes and you should stir
                        them two or three times so they cook evenly and don't stick to the bottom of the pan.
                    </p>
                    <h3>STEP 3</h3>
                    <p>Holding the tube over the pan, squirt in about 2 tsp of tomato purée, then stir it around so it
                        turns the vegetables red. Shoot the tomatoes in off the chopping board, sprinkle in a good pinch
                        of sugar and grind in a little black pepper. Tear 2 bay leaves into a few pieces and throw them
                        into the pan. Stir to mix everything together, put the lid on the pan and let the tomatoes stew
                        over a low heat for 10 minutes until they shrink down in the pan and their juices flow nicely.
                        From time to time, give the pan a good shake - this will keep everything well mixed.
                    </p>
                    <h3>STEP 4</h3>
                    <p>Slowly pour in the 1.2 litres of hot stock (made with boiling water and 4 rounded tsp
                        bouillon powder or 2 stock cubes), stirring at the same time to mix it with the vegetables. Turn
                        up the heat as high as it will go and wait until everything is bubbling, then turn the heat down
                        to low again and put the lid back on the pan. Cook gently for 25 minutes, stirring a couple of
                        times. At the end of cooking the tomatoes will have broken down and be very slushy-looking.
                    </p>
                    <h3>STEP 5</h3>
                    <p>Remove the pan from the heat, take the lid off and stand back for a few seconds or so while the
                        steam escapes, then fish out the pieces of bay leaf and throw them away. Ladle the soup into
                        your blender until it's about three-quarters full, fit the lid on tightly and turn the machine
                        on full. Blitz until the soup's smooth (stop the machine and lift the lid to check after about
                        30 seconds), then pour the puréed soup into a large bowl. Repeat with the soup that's left in
                        the pan. </p>
                    <h3>STEP 6</h3>
                    <p>Pour the puréed soup back into the pan and reheat it over a medium heat for a few minutes,
                        stirring occasionally until you can see bubbles breaking gently on the surface. Taste a spoonful
                        and add a pinch or two of salt if you think the soup needs it, plus more pepper and sugar if you
                        like. If the colour's not a deep enough red for you, plop in another teaspoon of tomato purée
                        and stir until it dissolves. Ladle into bowls and serve. Or sieve and serve chilled with some
                        cream swirled in.
